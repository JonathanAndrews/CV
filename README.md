## Jonathan Andrews

While undertaking a Masters in Neuroscience and Chemistry, I found that the most enjoyable part of the experience was coding my experiment in MATLAB. After graduating with a 1st, I trained to become a Software Developer at Makers Academy. I am hoping to find work as a Back-end web developer( or a Machine-learning engineer) in an environment where I can learn as much as possible.

## Skills

#### Analytical Reasoning

Masters Degree
- I have found that the key to solving larger problems is to break them down into a series of manageable steps and then to chain those steps together.
- The most obvious example of my applying this principle comes from my time at university.
 - I spent three years designing synthetic pathways to manufacture chemical compounds.
 - This involved modifying a starting compound through a series of individual reactions until the desired compound had been produced.

Account Planning Intern
- While working at VCCPme, I converted briefings from given to us by clients and into a strategy.
- I would break down the problem into three main parts:
 - How did the client/product want to be seen? (Brand Truth)
 - How were their competitors seen? (Market Truth)
 - Is there some experience, wisdom or aspect of life that can be tied to the promotion? (Human Truth)
- I would then pass on my findings to the creative department.
- While at VCCPme I:
 - Worked on Kia Motors and Southeastern Train accounts.
 - Developed strategies to increase foot traffic through key stations during off-peak periods.
 - Researched and presented analysis of Kia’s competitors’ tactics to promote Business Fleet Sales and Consumer After-Sales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including Study Abroad at **Johns Hopkins University, USA (August 2014 to June 2015)**

- MSci Neuroscience and Organic Chemistry
- 1st Class Honours
- For my Masters project, I designed and ran a study investigating Mirror Neurons, which are thought to play a role in learning, empathy and Autism.
  - The study required the precise measurement of response times to stimuli.
  - In order to do this, I used MATLAB to automate the experiment's stimuli presentation and response data collection.
