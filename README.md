# Jonathan Andrews

While undertaking a Masters in Neuroscience and Chemistry, I found that the most enjoyable part of the experience was coding my experiment in MATLAB. After graduating with a 1st, I trained to become a Software Developer at Makers Academy. I am logical, determined and hoping to find work as a web developer in an environment where I can learn as much as possible.

# Skills

### Analytical Reasoning

Masters Degree
- I have found that the key to solving larger problems is to break them down into a series of manageable steps and then to chain those steps together.
- The most obvious example of my applying this principle comes from my time at university.
  - I spent three years designing synthetic pathways to manufacture chemical compounds.
  - This involved modifying a starting compound through a series of individual reactions until the desired product had been produced.

Account Planning Intern
- While working at VCCPme, I converted briefings from given to us by clients and into a strategy.
- I would break down the problem into three main parts:
  - How did the client/product want to be seen? (Brand Truth)
  - How were their competitors seen? (Market Truth)
  - Is there some experience, wisdom or aspect of life that can be tied to the promotion? (Human Truth)
- I would then pass on my findings to the creative department.
- While at VCCPme I:
  - Worked on Kia Motors and Southeastern Train accounts.
  - Developed strategies to increase foot traffic through key stations during off-peak periods.
  - Researched and presented analysis of Kia’s competitors’ tactics to promote Business Fleet Sales and Consumer After-Sales.

### Adaptable

Study Abroad
- I spent my third year of my degree studying at Johns Hopkins University, USA.
- On arriving, I experienced two types of culture shock:
- Social
  - I found that not only did people struggle to understand what I was saying, but when they did understand, my self-deprecating sense of humour was met with genuine concern for my mental health.
  - I consciously adapted the aspects of my behaviour which were leading to social friction. For example, I started to speak more slowly and articulated my words properly.
- Academic.
  - I initially found the relentless mid-term testing very difficult.
  - I was also determined not to let the opportunity to "study anything I wanted" slip through my fingers, so on top of my full Neuroscience and Chemistry course load, I took classes in Marketing, Film theory and Screenwriting, eventually writing a screenplay and directing a short film.
  - This meant that I had an very heavy workload compared to previous years.
  - However, as time went on I became more efficient in my learning and by the end of the year I had not received a single grade below an A-.
- Although I adapted quickly to my changed with my environment, other exchange students hadn't...(See next section)

### Leadership

President and Co-Founder of JHU European Association
- After two months or so in America, I repeatedly met americans who hadn't met any of the exchange students and exchange students who had failed to make many american friends.
- In order to do something about this, a few friends and I founded the European Association.
- As president I led a committee of Frenchmen, Spaniards and Greeks, with a range of english language abilities.
  - First, we applied to found a society and passed all assessments and interviews from College Authorities.
  - Then using a loan of $100 we sold crepes in the quad to raise funds.
  - We then used the funds to create events providing opportunities for JHU students to discuss travelling and studying in Europe, plus social activities to promote discussion of cultural similarities and differences.
  - By inviting, both Americans and exchange students to the events, shy exchange students were able to meet more Americans.
  - Having repaid the loan, the year ended with 30 members and a surplus of $106 for future use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including Study Abroad at **Johns Hopkins University, USA (August 2014 to June 2015)**

- MSci Neuroscience and Organic Chemistry
- 1st Class Honours
- For my Masters project, I designed and ran a study investigating Mirror Neurons, which are thought to play a role in learning, empathy and Autism.
  - The study required the precise measurement of response times to stimuli.
  - In order to do this, I used MATLAB to automate the experiment's stimuli presentation and response data collection.
