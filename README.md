While undertaking a Masters in Neuroscience and Chemistry, I found that the scripting my experiment in MATLAB was very enjoyable. After graduating with a 1st, I trained to become a Software Developer at Makers Academy. I am logical, determined and looking work as a web developer in an environment where I can learn as much as possible.

# Skills

## Analytical Reasoning

Masters Degree

- I have found that the key to solving larger problems is to break them down into a series of manageable steps and then to chain those steps together.
- The most obvious example of my applying this principle comes from my time at university.
  - I spent three years designing synthetic pathways to manufacture chemical compounds.
  - This involved modifying a starting compound through a series of individual reactions until the desired product had been produced.

## Adaptable

Study Abroad

- I spent my third year of my degree studying at Johns Hopkins University, USA.
- On arriving, I found that people struggled to understand what I was saying, my self-deprecating sense of humour was met with genuine concern for my mental health and the relentless mid-term testing tough.
- However, by the end of the year, I was president of a society and had not received a single grade below an A-.

## Curious

Study Abroad

- While at Johns Hopkins, I was also determined not to let the opportunity to "study anything I wanted" slip through my fingers.
- On top of my full Neuroscience and Chemistry course load, I took classes in Marketing, Film theory and Screenwriting, eventually writing a screenplay and directing a short film.

## Leadership

President and Co-Founder of JHU European Association

- After two months or so in America, I repeatedly met Americans who hadn't met any of the exchange students and exchange students who had failed to make many American friends.
- In order to do something about this, a few friends and I founded the European Association.
  - As president I led a committee of Frenchmen, Spaniards and Greeks, with a range of english language abilities.
  - We organised events providing opportunities for JHU students to discuss travelling and studying in Europe, plus social activities to promote discussion of cultural similarities and differences.
  - By inviting, both Americans and exchange students to the events, shy exchange students were able to meet more Americans.
  - The year ended with 30 members and a surplus of $106 for future use.

## Client Contact

Account Planning Intern

- While working at VCCPme, I converted briefings from given to us by clients and into a strategy.
- While at VCCPme I:
  - Worked on Kia Motors and Southeastern Train accounts.
  - Developed promotional strategies to increase foot traffic through key stations during off-peak periods.
  - Researched and presented analysis of Kia’s competitors’ tactics to promote Business Fleet Sales and Consumer After-Sales.
